# LinearAlgebraThinking
Finally after months of crazy unsettling days, I get one day free from the chaos out of some  headache issuses. In the past 2 years and more, I survived  the course *Linear Algebra I* in 2020 Fall and then managed to be a Teaching Assistant of this course in 2021 Fall. And for 2021 Fall, I'm now studying the couse *'Linear Algebra in Info. Sci.'*, which brings interesting topics that make me constantly switching from familiar comfort zones to unexpected new approaches.

To preparing for the midterm, I started a review journey from vector space to abstract algebra with all the logic chains that can support me in problem solving with definitions, lemmas and theorems. Oddly, it resonates with concepts of Quantum Mechanics that I'm studying this term. Sci-fi story inspirations and logic models are poping out like it has beening hiding all the way. I was startled by how this process of abstract thinking can change the way that I perceive reallife events. 

So I decide to start a collection (maybe weekly updated) to keep records of new ideas and understandings brought by this 'Linear Algebra Thinking'. I'll say it's going to be quite exciting like a treasure hunt. Happy hunting, then!
